This package contains all the required functions for producing the [Farm Practices Survey (FPS)](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/farm-practices-survey) statistical notice, dataset and values for the time-series. The functions are designed to work within the FPS analysis pipeline which is a separate R Project. The pipeline pre-processes the FPS data exported from MS Access by the June team, analyses the data to produce means/ratios plus associated confidence intervals, and undertakes post-processing to format the data correctly for output using parameterised R Markdown to produce the statistical report on GOV.UK.
